**Date of Composition:** April 1, 2025

## I. declaration  

This document—the harmonic covenant—is a voluntary legal and ethical instrument. It is not owned, registered, or controlled by any institution. It exists through the act of composition and becomes enforceable through public acknowledgment and use.  

It is offered freely to all who recognize its purpose and choose to act in alignment with its terms.

---

## II. purpose  

The harmonic covenant provides a clear framework for:  
- Creative and collaborative work  
- Mutual respect and attribution  
- Voluntary association and open participation  

It offers an alternative to complex contracts and institutional permissions, grounded instead in shared intention, public clarity, and moral consistency.  

---

## III. participation and use  

You become a participant in the covenant simply by referencing it and choosing to operate under its principles.  

To apply this covenant to a creative work, collaboration, or idea, reference the following (or a clear equivalent):  
> “This work is governed by the harmonic covenant. Participation or adaptation is subject to its terms.”  

By using this covenant, you are agreeing to:  
- Act in good faith  
- Attribute foundational ideas when applicable  
- Preserve the covenant’s core principles if adapted  

---

## IV. propagation  

You may:  
- Adopt this covenant for your own work  
- Share it as a foundation for communities or organizations  
- Adapt or fork it, provided you:  
  - Clearly reference the original covenant  
  - Retain its principles of voluntary participation, transparency, and mutual respect  

Each adaptation is a continuation—not a replacement.

---

## V. legal grounding  

The harmonic covenant draws legal authority from established and enforceable domains of law:  

- **Common law contract:** Participation constitutes mutual agreement through acknowledgment and conduct.  
- **Copyright law:** As a published and original composition, the covenant carries enforceable moral rights and reuse conditions.  
- **Customary and ethical norms:** It reflects a tradition of good-faith agreements, peer governance, and open declarations of trust.  

While informal in form, this covenant is a valid legal instrument when invoked by consent. It may be referenced in disputes, cited in mediation or arbitration, or presented in relevant court proceedings as a record of agreed terms.

---

## VI. ethical boundary  

The harmonic covenant may not be used to justify or support:  
- Coercion  
- Exploitation  
- Deception  
- Abuse  
- Any action that knowingly degrades human dignity or erodes moral integrity

Any use in contradiction to these principles invalidates the covenant’s application in that context and is rejected in spirit and form.

---

## VII. continuity  

The covenant remains active as long as it is publicly acknowledged.  
Its authority does not depend on institutions.  
It is maintained by use, trust, and clarity alone.  

No claim may override the principles set forth herein.
